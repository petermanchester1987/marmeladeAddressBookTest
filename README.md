**A Small Address Book from a Coding Test - using React and Context API**

I haven't made an Address book before, but have made similar things such as my MERN stack social network. 
The brief asked for the contacts to be shown and for CRUD operations, so real test I found was changing my workflows to not incorporate a database, 
it certainly made me think about how to perform the operations without relying on a backend API, yet still be able to hide my API keys with mini Express server.

I decided to have another crack at using Context API, functional components and hooks, to manage state 
as I have a little less knowledge of that than class-based components and Redux.
It certainly makes it easier than prop mining, but I have a lot to learn to make it into a smoother workflow.

It was awkward to figure out a good debounce for API calls without lodash whilst using a functional component.

Whilst jobseeking I cant justify pay for the getAddressAPI so was using their test postcodes to check functionality. KW1 4YT and TR19 7AA.

I'm certainly keen for any feedback I can get at all, as I would love to learn from others!

Many Thanks

Peter
